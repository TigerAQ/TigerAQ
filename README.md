👋 Hi, I’m a tech leader who thrives on building high-performing teams and tackling complex challenges head-on:

🚀 12+ years of experience scaling infrastructure and leading global teams to success. I'm passionate about fostering diverse, collaborative environments where everyone can thrive.

🛠️ My toolkit:  Program management, cloud infrastructure, data migration, – all honed while delivering award-winning results (🏆 US Banking & Fintech Women in Technology Leadership Award 2024!).

🤖 Currently trying to geek out over:  Generative AI and its potential to revolutionize how we work and live.

🌎 Outside the tech world:  You'll find me snowboarding 🏂, exploring new places 🌍, or hanging out with any four-legged furry friends 🐾 (big fan!).

Let's connect! 📫 ailun.qin@gmail.com

Let's build solutions that matter to how we work and live!
